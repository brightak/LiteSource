# LiteSource
Source control in a batch script.

Say you have a pet project or maybe a class assignment.  You'd like to have version control but you don't need branches, you don't use concurrency, and you don't need to store to the cloud.  You just want something simple -- maybe on your thumb drive -- that you can use to track changes from your Windows system.  Enter LiteSource.

Run it from your source folder to back everything up.

Or run it from an empty folder and tell it what folder to track.

Rename it first and the repo folder will be renamed accordingly. It will ignore files that are identical to it.
